Go Policy Enforcer is a flexible, lightweight library that allows
developers to dynamically enforce policies on Go structs using
customizable rules and reflection. This library is useful for
scenarios such as access control, validation, and policy-based
filtering of data.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚ö° **Dynamic Policy Enforcement**: Apply rules dynamically without
hardcoding logic.
- üîç **Reflection-Based Field Access**: Leverages Go's reflection
to access and evaluate struct fields.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Operators**: Supports custom operators like
`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, and more.
- üì¶ **Extensible**: Easily add new rules and policies to
adapt to your use case.

## üìö Installation

Install the package via `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/kmesiab/go-policy-enforcer
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Go Policy Enforcer to enforce rules
on your Go structs:

### Define Your Struct

```go
type Asset struct {
    ID        string
    Type      string
    Finalized bool
}
```

### Define Your Policies

Policies can be written to define what rules need to be enforced on
a given struct.

```go
policies := []Policy{
    {
        Name: "FinalizedPolicy",
        Rules: []Rule{
        {Field: "Finalized", Operator: "==", Value: true},
    },
    {
        Name: "TypePolicy",
        Rules: []Rule{
        {Field: "Type", Operator: "==", Value: "asset"},
    },
}
```

### Enforce Policies

Create a policy enforcer and apply the rules to your struct:

```go
resource := Asset{
    ID:        "1",
    Type:      "asset",
    Finalized: true,
}

enforcer := NewPolicyEnforcer(&policies)

if enforcer.Enforce(resource) {
    fmt.Println("Asset passes all policies")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Asset failed one or more policies")
}
```

## PolicyEnforcer `Match` Function

The `Match` function in the `PolicyEnforcer` class is designed to evaluate
resources against a set of policies. It checks if the provided resource
satisfies the conditions defined in any of the policies and returns a
list of the matching policies.

### How it Works

The `Match` function takes a resource as input and evaluates each policy's
rules against that resource. Each policy contains a set of rules, and the
resource is checked to see if it satisfies all the rules in a policy. If
a resource satisfies all the rules in a policy, that policy is considered
a match, and it is added to the list of matched policies.

The `Match` function does not stop at the first match. It continues evaluating
the resource against all available policies and returns all the matching
policies.

#### Usage Example

Here is an example of how to use the `Match` function:

```go
// Define some policies
policies := []Policy{
    {
        Name: "FinalizedPolicy",
        Rules: []Rule{
        {Field: "Finalized", Operator: "==", Value: true},
    },
    {
        Name: "TypePolicy",
        Rules: []Rule{
        {Field: "Type", Operator: "==", Value: "asset"},
    },
}

// Define a resource that will be evaluated against the policies
resource := struct {
    Age    int
    Status string
}{
    Age:    30,
    Status: "active",
}

// Create a PolicyEnforcer instance with the policies
enforcer := PolicyEnforcer{
    Policies: policies,
}

// Use the Match function to find matching policies
matchedPolicies := enforcer.Match(resource)

// Output the names of the matched policies
for _, policy := range matchedPolicies {
    fmt.Println("Matched policy:", policy.Name)
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

- The example defines two policies: one that checks if the Age of the
resource is greater than 25, and another that checks if the Status is ‚Äúactive‚Äù.
- The resource is an object with two fields: Age and Status.
- The Match function evaluates the resource against the policies. Since
both policies match the resource, their names are printed as output.
