# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the
Go Policy Enforcer project, we pledge to
make participation in our project and community
a welcoming, respectful, and constructive experience
for everyone.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

- **Be Respectful**: Communicate openly, treat each other
with respect, and avoid language that is derogatory or demeaning.
- **Be Collaborative**: Work together to resolve conflicts
constructively and provide thoughtful, actionable feedback.
- **Be Open**: Accept constructive criticism graciously
- and be open to different viewpoints and ideas.
- **Help Create a Welcoming Environment**: Show empathy toward
other contributors and ensure a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

### Unacceptable Behavior

- **Harassment**: Including, but not limited to, offensive comments, threats,
and unwelcome advances.
- **Disrespectful Communication**: Such as insults, ad hominem attacks, or
derogatory remarks.
- **Disruptive Behavior**: Persistent interruption or monopolizing conversations
that prevent others from participating.
- **Violations of Privacy**: Sharing personal information or any content
- without consent.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for upholding this Code of Conduct.
They have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that are not
aligned with our standards. In serious cases, maintainers may suspend or
permanently ban any contributor from the project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including
GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions on other official channels
(e.g., Slack or email). It also applies when an individual is representing
the project in public spaces.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or observe unacceptable behavior, please report it to the
project maintainers by emailing the [maintainer](mailto:kmesiab@gmail com)
. All reports will be handled with discretion.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may result
in a temporary or permanent ban from the project at the discretion of the
maintainers.

## Acknowledgments

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1,
which is widely adopted in the open-source community.
